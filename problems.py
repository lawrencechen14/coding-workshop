# Your robot is at 0 on a number line. It decides to move n steps
# but there are a few constraints! If the step he is currently taking is a multiple
# of 3, then he will move 3 positions forward. If the step he is taking
# is a multiple of 5, then he will move 10 positions back. Also, if the
# step is a multiple of 15, then he will move 8 positions forward. If the step
# doesn't satisfy any of the above criteria, then simply move 1 position forward.
# Implement the function robot_stepper that will output the final
# position the robot will be at after n steps.
# Examples:
#
#   >>> robot_stepper(1)
#   1
#   >>> robot_stepper(3)

# Create a function is_leap_year(year) that determines whether
# the given year is a leap year.
#
# A year is a leap year if the year is divisible by four and
# the year is not divisible by 100. However, years divisible
# by 400 are leap years, and are an exception to the 100-year
# rule.
#
#
# Hint: "a % b" calculates the remainder of dividing a by b,
#       so "a % b == 0" is true if a is divisible by b.

# Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the
# following mathematical puzzle.
#
# Pick a positive integer n as the start.
# If n is even, divide it by 2.
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Continue this process until n is 1.
# The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all
# numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence
# will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere
# before eventually landing on earth.
#
# This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a
# function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n, prints out
# the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the
# sequence:
